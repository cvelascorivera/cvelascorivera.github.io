<p> While at Princeton, I have been a teaching assistant in various
 courses at the undergraduate and graduate level in the Politics
 Department and the <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/">Woodrow Wilson
 School</a>. In addition, I was
 the instructor for the introductory course on quantitive analysis
 offered by the Woodrow Wilson School as part of its <a

Professor <a href="http://imai.princeton.edu/">Kosuke Imai</a></p>

<p>What accounts for who votes and their choice of candidate? Would universal health insurance improve the health of the poor? Researchers and policy makers use statistics to answer these questions. However, the validity of their conclusions depends upon underlying assumptions and correct application of statistical methods. The course will introduce basic principles of statistical inference and programming skills for data analysis. The goal is to provide students with the foundation necessary to analyze data in their independent research at Princeton and to become a critical consumer of news articles and academic studies that use statistics.
